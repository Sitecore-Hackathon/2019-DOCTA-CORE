<h2>What is the definition of low testosterone (Low-T)?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Testosterone is a hormone required for male development and sexual function and is produced primarily in the testicles.</li>
    <li>Testosterone is responsible for building muscle and bone mass, sperm production, and sex drive.</li>
    <li>Testosterone influences male pattern fat distribution, bone density, and red blood cell production.</li>
    <li>In the normal developing male, testosterone peaks during early adulthood. Once you reach age 30, testosterone levels slowly decline by approximately 1% a year. This is a normal part of aging.</li>
